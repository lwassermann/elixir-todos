Following [the Phoenix Live View Todo Tutorial](https://dennisbeatty.com/2019/04/24/how-to-create-a-todo-list-with-phoenix-liveview.html?utm_campaign=elixir_radar_187&utm_medium=email&utm_source=RD+Station), some finger exercises to get more comfortable.

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install --prefix assets`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
